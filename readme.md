# MiniChallengeFiveToSeven - Endpoints

## Overview
Design an API with 4 endpoints based on mini challenges from the Combine. Each endpoint must adhere to the following structure:
- Each endpoint must have its own **Controller** file, placed inside a `Controller` folder.
- Each endpoint must have its own **Service** file, placed inside a `Service` folder.
- Validation is required.

## Endpoints

### 1. MadLib
Create an endpoint that accepts multiple inputs. The output should be a story based on those values.

### 2. OddOrEven
Create an endpoint that determines if a number entered is odd or even.

### 3. ReverseIt (Alphanumeric)
Create an endpoint that accepts a sequence of numbers and letters, then reverses them.  
Example:
```
You entered 123ABC, reversed is CBA321
```

### 4. ReverseIt (Numbers Only)
Create an endpoint that accepts a sequence of only numbers and reverses them. The output should display both the original and the reversed sequence.  
Example:
```
You entered 12345, reversed is 54321
```

### Overall Feedback
Overall great job!
MadLib - works fine, not sure how much inputs they want but if this much is fine it is good.
OddOrEven - everything works, has validation, no changes needed, great job
ReverseItAlphanumerical - great job, using reverse method is probably easier way to do it
ReverseItNumbers - was pretty much the same as ReverseItAlphNumerical. just caution: I think they wanted us to use the mathematical way to do it with modulo so I recommend asking just in case so you don't get docked points.
